  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished migrating my blog from
<a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a> to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.
Posterous was acquired by Twitter a few months ago and is now in
maintenance mode. I&#8217;m now hosting this blog for free on
<a href="http://github.com/olalonde/olalonde.github.com">Github</a> and
use Octopress/Jekyll to generate the files. So far, it is really a joy to write all
my posts in Markdown. I&#8217;m basically blogging from Vim right now (and using the <a href="https://github.com/matthias-guenther/hammer.vim">Hammer plugin</a> to preview my posts). I wish I had done this move earlier.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;3 Jekyll + Octopress + Github + Markdown + Vim + Hammer.vim
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So today I am cleaning up my phone&rsquo;s Memo app so this post will be
dedicated to dumping all those late night ideas I had when I was very
tired or had a few too many beers. Note that I had most of those ideas
independently but some of them were (partially) implemented later on
or I simply hadn&rsquo;t heard of them.</p>




<h2>1. Beetcoin</h2>




<p>Mobile app that acts as a nice UI on top of various Bitcoin exchanges.
It should be possible to view pending trades, get current bid/ask
prices and place new trades.</p>




<p><strong>The twist:</strong> Sell it as a paid app and give away &ldquo;free&rdquo; Bitcoins. The
app should be expensive enough that when you give away Bitcoins you
still make a profit.</p>




<p><strong>Why it will work:</strong> This would enable regular people to buy Bitcoins
with their credit card by buying the app on the Android market.</p>




<p><strong>Why it won&rsquo;t work:</strong> It is possibly against most markets / credit card
processors TOS.</p>




<h2>2. Code reading web app</h2>




<p>Reading other people&rsquo;s code is one of the surest way to improve your
programming skills. For each programming language, this app would list
open source projects by difficulty level (from beginner to expert) and
make it easy to browse and comment the code from within the website.
The MVP could simply list links to Github repos. Inspiration comes
from <a href="http://todomvc.com">http://todomvc.com</a>.</p>




<p>Use case: I just started to learn Javascript and I want to see some
real world Javascript code. I go to the site, select the Javascript
language and I can see a list of projects rated from Beginner level to
Expert level. Each projects that are at the same difficulty level are
grouped together. The beginner level should list simple &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;
apps while the expert level should be reserved for complex projects.</p>




<h2>3. Prediction market, Hacker News style</h2>




<p>Not sure what I meant when writing this. I think the idea is that it
would be a news aggregator like Hacker News but when you vote up it
costs you real money (you are investing in a vote). If the vote count
goes up, you are rewarded for predicting correctly that the article
was interesting to the community. The reward should be proportional to
how many people up voted after you. I guess someone still needs to
work out the &ldquo;details&rdquo;. The whole idea is to mix karma with money to
self-moderate a community (most people care more about money than
karma).</p>




<h2>4. OAuth for payments</h2>




<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why I haven&rsquo;t seen this yet in the wild. Probably due to
legal compliance and security issues. But well, I think it would be
cool if I could just buy stuff by clicking &ldquo;Pay 10$&rdquo; and whenever I
click that button, I get the standard OAuth dialog asking me to
authorize the payment. There should be a maximum amount by transaction
which should be fairly low if security is an issue (50$?).</p>




<h2>5. URL#hash renderer API</h2>




<p>I first had this idea when developing a website with Backbone.js. All
my URLs looked like <a href="http://domain/#a/b/c">http://domain/#a/b/c</a> and I thought it would be
nice if my server could proxy all requests to <a href="http://domain/a/b/c">http://domain/a/b/c</a>
through an API that returns the rendered HTML of <a href="http://domain/#a/b/c">http://domain/#a/b/c</a>.</p>




<p>Some websites are not crawlable or unusable if users don&rsquo;t have
Javascript enabled. This service takes an url of the form
<a href="http://domain/#hash">http://domain/#hash</a> and returns the rendered HTML that a user would
see if they had Javascript enabled. Web developers could use this
service to easily offer a crawlable website that is friendly to
visitors that have Javascript disabled.</p>




<h2>6. Startups for front-end developers</h2>




<p>Build a service that makes it possible to develop a full website
completely on the client side (probably using Backbone.js or similar),
interfacing with a list of predefined APIs. This startups&#8217; job would
be to take care of providing a list of easily accessible APIs and make
it easy for designers to publish UIs that interact with the APIs. The
startup should also take care of common issues like cross-origin
request sharing, caching, etc. Eventually, there would be a market
where developers can publish APIs. This idea is rooted in the idea of
division of labor. Backend developers should focus on what they do
best and so should frontend developers. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if all
startups out there were simply a REST API with dozens of UIs you can
chose from. What if Paypal was simply an API and anyone could build a
nice UI on top of that API.</p>




<h2>7. Hacker News directory</h2>




<p>List all Hacker News related services, websites, Chrome extensions,
publications, apps, etc. There is currently no such official website.</p>




<h2>8. &ldquo;Hello dear [social network] user. I would really appreciate if you [tweeted/liked/up voted] this.&rdquo;</h2>




<p>This idea was inspired by seeing a few &ldquo;I see you are coming from HN.
Please up vote and comment.&rdquo; when clicking submissions on HN.</p>




<p>This should be a small embeddable script or iframe which should
display a small message asking to share the current page on a given
social network. The social network is chosen using the visitor&rsquo;s HTTP
referer header or their browser&rsquo;s history. The script should first
check if their referrer matches a social network and if not, use the
browser history hack to see if the user has recently visited a known
social network. This would be a good alternative for people who want
to have multiple sharing buttons but don&rsquo;t want to clutter the screen
real estate with too many choices.</p>




<h2>9. Offline Hacker News mobile app</h2>




<p>Whenever I have to go on a long subway ride with no 3G or Wifi, I
really wish I could just click a button that would load all HN&rsquo;s front
page submissions + comments and load them in my browser&rsquo;s tab before I
leave. Hence, the offline HN app idea.</p>




<h2>10. Github orphan</h2>




<p><strong>Update:</strong> this appears to have been somewhat solved since I had this
idea. See <a href="http://stillmaintained.com">http://stillmaintained.com</a></p>




<p>There should be an easy way to orphan and adopt new projects in Github.</p>




<h3>Use case: You want to orphan a project</h3>




<p>Connect with Github. Select project to orphan.</p>




<p>This automatically writes this at the top of your README file:</p>




<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># ADOPT ME! #
I am no longer able to maintain this project. Click here to adopt it!</pre></div>
</div>




<h3>Use case: You want to adopt a project</h3>




<ol>
<li>Visit a Github project. See that it is open for adoption.</li>
<li>Click the adopt link in the README file.</li>
<li>Authenticate with Github</li>
<li>Wait for adoption authorization by current maintainer</li>
</ol>




<h3>Use case: Approve adopter</h3>




<ol>
<li>You see that someone applied to become a new maintainer for your project.</li>
<li>Click Approve.</li>
<li><p>Erase everything in your repository except a single README file:</p>

<p>   # THIS PROJECT IS NOW MAITAINED BY &lsquo;new maintainer&rsquo; AT
   github.com/new-maintainer/blabla #</p></li>
</ol>




<h2>11. Public transportation visualization and simulation</h2>




<p>Update: There is something in that vein available for London:
<a href="http://busmapper.co.uk/">http://busmapper.co.uk/</a>. Hey guys, if you are reading this, I&rsquo;m
available for hire :)</p>




<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if you could see buses and subways on a map
traveling &ldquo;real time&rdquo; and seeing where they are going at a glance.
Let&rsquo;s say your on some street and want to go in some direction (let&rsquo;s
say downtown), you could just open that mobile app, see which buses
are coming your way and where they are going to. The simulation could
be computed by using bus schedule and averaging the speed between two
stops. I prototyped this a few years ago at
<a href="http://dev.syskall.com/map">http://dev.syskall.com/map</a>.</p>




<h2>12. Quadcopter delivery</h2>




<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://tacocopter.com/">Taco Copter</a></p>




<p>In areas of high density and high rise buildings, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice
if you could order something from 7/11 and have a quadcopter (semi-)
autonomously deliver your stuff through the window/balcony?</p>




<h2>13. Pixel copter advertising</h2>




<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/flyfire/">MIT flyfire</a></p>




<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have a fleet of programmable mini pixel copters
(small helicopters that carry a colored light) draw images / video in
the sky. This could be used for promotion and advertising.</p>




<h2>14. Online food delivery</h2>




<p>This problem has been tackled many times and there are a few companies
doing it right now but it still hasn&rsquo;t gain lots of momentum. Anyways,
the idea is that you could just open up a mobile app / web app and
through geolocation, get a list of restaurants that can deliver to
your location. You can filter out the restaurants by cost, food type,
etc. You can then navigate to the menu and place your order.</p>




<p><strong>The twist:</strong> There are a lot of &ldquo;Amazon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ebays&rdquo; in that space but I
haven&rsquo;t seen any &ldquo;Shopifys&rdquo; so far. Meaning that most of the startups
in that space, have a central website where they list restaurants.
Probably some restaurants would be interested in a white label
solution where they could host on their own domain and customize
everything to their needs.</p>




<h2>15. Instant UML diagram for a given Github repository</h2>




<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted something like this. Select a given Github
repository and instantly get an UML class diagram, whatever the
language is. UML is not really a good fit for more dynamical languages
but nowadays there are statical analysis tools even for Javascript and
company.</p>




<h2>16. Ad-hoc sport teams</h2>




<p>You want to play a game of soccer? Open up this web app, change you
status to &ldquo;I want to play soccer in the next X hours&rdquo;. When there is
enough people who want to play at the same time as you within a given
geographical zone, we all notify you, you chose a location/time and
the game begins!</p>




<h2>17. Hotel Wifi web app</h2>




<p>You connect to your hotel&rsquo;s wifi and on first browser request, you get
redirected to this web app. The web app, displays events in the area,
there is a chatroom for other lonely and bored travelers, you can
order stuff from the hotel directly from the web app, there hotel
guest specific promotions from local businesses, etc. Maybe you will
find someone with similar tastes in the chatroom and you can hang out
together in this unknown city?</p>




<h2>Conclusion</h2>




<p>I think that&rsquo;s about it for now. I will update the post if I bump into
more crazy ideas while cleaning up my phone. Let me know what you
think in the comments and I&rsquo;d love to know if you&rsquo;re solving one of
these problems or planning to!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>Back in 2011,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jpf">Jo&euml;l Franusic</a> published a <a href="http://jpf.github.com/domain-profiler/ycombinator.html">neat visualization</a> of all <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> startups&#8217; hosting decisions using his neat open source <a href="https://github.com/jpf/domain-profiler">domain-profiler</a> software.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Only a few weeks ago, there seemed to be absolutely no interest for tech startups in Shenzhen, China (or at least, among the English speaking community). As a startup guy, I was pretty upset by the seemingly&nbsp;nonexistent&nbsp;community. Of course, there was Hong Kong nearby with a <a href="http://www.hksua.com.hk/">vibrant</a> <a href="http://boot.hk">community</a> but I wanted something in Shenzhen.&nbsp;I decided I&#8217;d prove myself wrong by creating a &#8221;<a href="http://www.shenzhenstuff.com/group/startups">Startups and technology SZ</a>&#8221; group on a popular expat social network called <a href="http://ShenzhenStuff.com">ShenzhenStuff.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>It turned I was wrong about the lack of interest! The group grew to 32 members within only a few days. Within the same time frame, <a href="http://blog.michaelmichelini.com/">Michael Michelini</a>, an American expat, and his associates were officially launching a <a href="http://www.szteam.com">coworking space</a> aimed at web workers and freelancers. Talk about timing! Michael from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.szteam.com">SZTeam</a>&nbsp;offered to host and run a first &#8220;Startup Tuesday&#8221; meeting which turned out to be a huge success.</p>


<p>Michael wrote a nice <a href="http://szteam.com/387">outline of the event</a>&nbsp;and published <a href="http://szteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Shenzhen-Team-Startups-Tuesday.pdf">his slides</a>. The ~50 (I suck at guesstimates) attendees came from all kinds of backgrounds (technical, business, finance, curious people, etc.) and the crowd was about half foreigners, half Chinese.&nbsp;</p>


<p />
<div><img src="http://blog.michaelmichelini.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hugely-successful-shenzhen-startup-meeting-tuesday.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p />
<div>For the upcoming events, many suggestions were made: invite speakers to talk about a specific topic, co-founder &#8220;speed dating&#8221;, startup weekends, pitch nights, etc. I&#8217;m particularly interested in co-founder speed dating as I&#8217;m <a href="mailto:olalonde@gmail.com">looking for a co-founder</a> :)</div>
<p />
<div>This first meeting was a huge success and Michael deserves all the credit. I would also&nbsp;recommend <a href="http://www.szteam.com">SZTeam</a> to freelancers or anyone who is working on a startup. The people are friendly, there is a nice conference room, free coffee and the pricing is pretty cheap: hot desk for 500 RMB/month (80 USD/month) and fixed desk for 1500 RMB/month (235 USD/month).</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>From now on, we will try to gather the community around the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/shenzhen-startup/subscribe">Shenzhen Startup</a> mailing list and the <a href="http://www.shenzhenstuff.com/group/startups">Startups and technology SZ</a> group. <a href="http://www.szteam.com">SZTeam</a> will continue to host <a href="http://szteam.com/location">Startup Tuesday</a>&nbsp;every Tuesday 7pm.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>I think we are on the right path to build a vibrant startup community in Shenzhen!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As well all know, Javascript isn&rsquo;t allowed in Posterous themes. Luckily, iframes are and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll use to go around the no Javascript limitation.</p>




<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DnUlw.png" alt="posterous screenshot" /></p>




<p>Simply go to your Posterous dashboard, click &quot;Settings&quot; on the top right, then click the &quot;Edit Theme&quot; button and select the &quot;Advanced tab&quot;. Now, all you have to do is paste one of the following snippets where you want the button to show up and click the &quot;Save, I&rsquo;m done!&quot; button.</p>




<ul>
<li>Standard button:</li>
</ul>




<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1003860.js"></script></p>




<ul>
<li>Tall button:</li>
</ul>




<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1003872.js"></script></p>




<p>That&rsquo;s all you have to do to integrate Google +1 to your Posterous.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There is now a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries using pure JavaScript: <a href="https://github.com/rbranson/node-ffi">node-ffi</a>. Also, <code>node-waf</code> is no longer being used to compile Node.js extensions.</p>

<p><em>TRANSLATIONS</em>: This post was translated to Chinese:
<a href="http://www.oschina.net/translate/how-to-write-your-own-native-nodejs-extension">http://www.oschina.net/translate/how-to-write-your-own-native-nodejs-extension</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><em>This is a follow up to <a href="http://syskall.com/how-to-roll-out-your-own-javascript-api-with">How to roll out your own Javascript API with V8</a>. You should still be able to follow if you haven&#8217;t read it.</em></p>

<p>We will now port the <a href="https://github.com/olalonde/node-notify">code we have written for V8</a> to <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and package it for <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/n7ZIw.png" alt="node-notify screenshot" /></p>

<p>The full source code of this tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/olalonde/node-notify">from github</a>:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/olalonde/jsnotify.git
</code></pre>

<p>You can also install it through <code>npm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>npm install notify
</code></pre>

<p>The code was tested on Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit and Node.js v0.5.0-pre.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>First let’s create a node-notify folder and with the following directory structure.</p>

<pre><code>.
|-- build/                   # This is where our extension is built. 
|-- demo/
|   `-- demo.js              # This is a demo Node.js script to test our extension.
|-- src/
|   `-- node_gtknotify.cpp   # This is the where we do the mapping from C++ to Javascript.
`-- wscript                  # This is our build configuration used by node-waf
</code></pre>

<p><em>This fine looking tree was generated with the <code>tree</code> utility.</em></p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s create our test script <code>demo.js</code> and decide upfront what our extension&#8217;s API should look like:</p>

<h2>Writing our Node.js extension</h2>

<h3>The Init method</h3>

<p>In order to create a Node.js extension, we need to write a C++ class that extends <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node_object_wrap.h">node::ObjectWrap</a>. ObjectWrap implements some utility methods that lets us easily interface with Javascript.</p>

<p>All that is left to do is to write the C++ methods that we used in our Init method: <code>New</code>, <code>GetTitle</code>, <code>SetTitle</code>, <code>GetIcon</code>, <code>SetIcon</code>, <code>Send</code></p>

<h3>Our constructor method: New()</h3>

<p>The New() method creates an instance of our class (a Gtknotify object), sets some default values to our properties and returns a Javascript handle to this object. This is the expected behavior when calling a constructor function with the new operator in Javascript.</p>

<p><code>node-waf</code> is the build tool used to compile Node extensions which is basically a wrapper for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/waf/">waf</a>. The build process can be configured with a file called <code>wscript</code> in our top directory:</p>

<h2>Packaging for npm</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty cool, but how about sharing your hard work with the Node community? That&#8217;s primarily what the Node Package Manager is used for: making it easy to import extensions/modules and distribute them.</p>

<p>Packaging an extension for npm is very straightforward. All you have to do is create a <code>package.json</code> file in your top directory which contains some info about your extension:</p>

<p><em>For more details on the package.json format, documentation is available through <code>npm help json</code>. Note that most fields are optional.</em></p>

<p>You can now install your new npm package by running <code>npm install</code> in your top directory. If everything goes right, you should be able to load your extension with a simple <code>var notify = require('your-package-name');</code>. Another useful command is <code>npm link</code> which creates a symlink to your development directory so that any change to your code is reflected instantly - no need to install/uninstall perpetually.</p>

<p>Assuming you wrote a cool extension, you might want to publish it online in the central npm repository. In order to do that, you first need to create an account:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm adduser
</code></pre>

<p>Next, go back to the root of your package code and run:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm publish
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it, your package is now available for anyone to install through the <code>npm install your-package-name</code> command.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Writing a native Node extension can be cumbersome and verbose at times but it is well worth the hard earned bragging rights!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Let me know in the comments if you run into any problem, I’ll be glad to help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Update: I wrote a new tutorial on porting our V8 code as a Node.js extension: <a href="http://syskall.com/how-to-write-your-own-native-nodejs-extension">How to write your own native Node.js extension</a>.</em></p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compile the V8 Javascript engine</li>
<li>Bind a Javascript function to your own C++ function</li>
</ol>


<p>For the sake of demonstration and to impress your co-workers, we will bind a Javascript function &#8220;alert()“ that will display desktop notifications through the GTK library. Here’s what the end result looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nUsWG.png" alt="jsnotify screenshot" /></p>

<p>You can get the full source code of this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/olalonde/jsnotify">from github</a>:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/olalonde/jsnotify.git
</code></pre>

<p>This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 64-bit but should work fine on any Linux distribution. The notification part requires the GTK+ library.</p>

<h2>Compiling Google’s V8 Javascript engine</h2>

<p>First, let’s make sure we have all the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/build.html">required tools and dependencies</a> to compile.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential scons subversion 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The build-essential package is a meta package that installs all the necessary tools and libraries to compile C++ programs.</li>
<li>SCons is a build tool which attempts to replace the classic “make” and is used by the V8 project.</li>
<li>Subversion is needed to checkout the source code of V8.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, let’s grab V8’s source from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/Source?tm=4">official repository</a>:</p>

<pre><code>svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8 
</code></pre>

<p>We can now move into the V8 directory and try to compile!</p>

<pre><code>cd v8;
scons arch=x64; 
</code></pre>

<p>The “arch=x64” option specifies that we want to build a 64-bit version of V8 (the default value would be 32-bit otherwise).</p>

<p>If V8 compiled fine, you should now have a libv8.a file in your v8/ directory. As you probably guessed, libv8.a is the library that our C++ program will use to execute Javascript code.</p>

<p>So, if everything compiled fine, just skip to the next section. Otherwise, keep on reading.</p>

<p>When you get errors as a result of compiling third party code, it is usually due to the fact that the compiler can’t find required libraries (/usr/lib) and/or their associated header files (/usr/lib/include). The latter are usually available through packages conventionally named <em>libname</em>-dev . In order to find out which package installs a given file, there is a neat utility called <code>apt-file</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install apt-file;
apt-file search missing-header-file.h; 
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>apt-file search</code> command lists the package(s) that install a given file (<em>missing-header-file.h</em> in this case). If there are more than one package listed, we have to take a semi-educated guess on which package we should install based on its name (let me know in the comments if you know of a better trick!). We then simply install the package with the usual <code>apt-get install package-name</code> command.</p>

<p>Hint: If you are on Ubuntu 10.04, you might need to install the following packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i368 lib32stdc++6
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we’ve installed all the missing files, the compilation should work. Let&#8217;s move on to the next section.</p>

<p>If you are still stuck with compiling V8, <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/2009/07/11/compiling-node-js-olibc6-dev-i368n-ubuntu-9-04/">this tutorial</a> might help.</p>

<h2>Building our own Javascript API</h2>

<p>Now that we have successfully compiled the V8 library, we will build our own C++ project that will be “Javascript scriptable”. This means that our program will be able to run Javascript code which in turn will be able to call our custom C++ functions.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> You can also get the full source code of this tutorial from my <a href="(https://github.com/olalonde/jsnotify">jsnotify github repository</a>): <code>git clone git://github.com/olalonde/jsnotify.git</code></p>

<p>First let’s create our file structure.</p>

<pre><code>jsnotify/
  |-- deps/  # third party code
  |   `-- v8  # move your v8 folder here
  `-- src/ # our code goes here
      `-- jsnotify.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s copy the sample code available at <code>deps/v8/samples/shell.cc</code> and paste it into jsnotify.cpp. The sample code given by V8 let’s you execute a Javascript file or start an interactive Javascript shell. It also binds some useful Javascript functions such as print() which will output text to the terminal.</p>

<p>Let’s try to compile this!</p>

<pre><code>g++ src/jsnotify.cpp; 
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this gives us a bunch of errors since we haven’t specified where the V8 header and library files are. Let’s try again!</p>

<pre><code>g++ src/jsnotify.cpp -Ideps/v8/include -Ldeps/v8/ -lv8
</code></pre>

<p>Oops, still some errors. Looks like we also have to link the pthread library.</p>

<pre><code>g++ src/jsnotify.cpp -Ideps/v8/include -Ldeps/v8/ -lv8 -lpthread
</code></pre>

<p>This finally compiles! Now that we have our mini Javascript shell, let’s play a bit with it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./a.out

</span><span class='line'>&gt; print<span class="o">(</span>foo<span class="o">)</span>;
</span><span class='line'>Hello World
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, all we have to do is to create our custom alert() function in C++.</p>

<p>Now that we have our Alert C++ function, we need to tell V8 to bind it to the Javascript alert() function. This is done by adding the following code in the RunMain function:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// INSERT AFTER v8::Handle&lt;v8::ObjectTemplate&gt; global = v8::ObjectTemplate::New();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Bind the global &#39;alert&#39; function to the C++ Alert callback.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">global</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">Set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v8</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">New</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;alert&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">v8</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">FunctionTemplate</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">New</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Alert</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, in order to compile, the compiler needs to know where to find the two header files we introduced. This is done using the pkg-config utility:</p>

<pre><code>g++ src/jsnotify.cpp -Ideps/v8/include -Ldeps/v8/ -lv8 -lpthread `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtkmm-2.4 libnotifymm-1.0`
</code></pre>

<p>We can now try our new alert function.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$.</span>/a.out
</span><span class='line'>V8 version 3.1.5
</span><span class='line'>&gt; alert<span class="o">(</span>“wow, it works!”<span class="o">)</span>;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should see a nice notification in the top right of your screen! Note that you can also put you Javascript code in a file and pass the file name as an argument <code>./a.out filename.js</code>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s quite easy to make a C++ program &#8220;Javascriptable&#8221; with V8 and the proper setup. If you&#8217;d like to practice your newfound skills, I suggest you try to add a title argument to the alert function. You might also want to follow me on Posterous if you&#8217;d like to be informed when I post the follow up to this tutorial which will explain how to extend <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> with our alert function.</p>

<p>That’s all for today, thanks for reading! Let me know in the comments if you run into any problem, I’ll be glad to help.</p>
