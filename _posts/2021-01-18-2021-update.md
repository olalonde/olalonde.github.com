I just realised I hadn't updated my blog in over 5 years ðŸ˜¯. So here's a
quick recap of my past 5 years.

I wrote a "read-only wallet" for Bitcoin that was designed to be used
for Bitcoin charities to be totally transparent about their
finances. In the process, I essentially wrote a full Bitcoin node from
scratch in Node.js which used Postgres as a data store.

The project didn't gain much traction but it lead to me joining Blockai,
a startup that was using the Bitcoin blockchain to register and digitize
copyrights (using the `OP_RETURN` opcode). The startup pivoted multiple
times and was re-branded to Binded.com. We eventually got acquired by
[Pixsy.com](http://pixsy.com/).

During my time as CTO and co-founder of Binded, I got to manage a small
team of engineers. I also did a lot of deep learning, which I had to
learn on the spot: I completed Stanford's Machine Learning course as well
as the Deep Learning specialisation on Coursera by Andrew Ng, which I
highly recommend. I also learned a lot about information retrieval
systems and DevOps (Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure as code,
etc.).

After Binded's acquisition in 2019, I did a lot of open source
development (e.g. [added a new crypto API to
Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34600)), some freelancing,
learned Rust and learned a lot about Ethereum, DeFi and finance. I also
had a few successful investments. I am currently working on a new
project at the intersection of algorithmic trading, DeFi and
cryptocurrency.
