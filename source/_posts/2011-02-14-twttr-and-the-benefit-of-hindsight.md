<p>I recently stumbled upon a quite interesting piece of history buried in TechCrunch's archives. It's <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">a July 2006 article written by Michael Arrington</a>&nbsp;which introduces a "sort of &ldquo;group send&rdquo; SMS application" as he described it at the time. For those who haven't guessed yet, the "application" he is referring to is now known as <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, a&nbsp;190 million users strong&nbsp;social network and company currently&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/02/10/understanding-twitters-valuation/">valued at around $10 billion</a>. Yet,&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;very few people believed the startup had any chance of success and even fewer could have predicted it would grow to become a billion dollar company.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Here are some gems from the article and comments. It would be superfluous to comment them as I believe they speak for themselves. If you find yourself laughing at this (as I did), take a moment to realize just how wonderful the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias">benefit of hindsight</a> is.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>All comments date from 2006. I didn't include the names of the&nbsp;commenters (but they <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/#disqus_thread">aren't really hard to find</a>).</div>

Every user has a&nbsp;public page&nbsp;that shows all of their messages. Messages from that person&rsquo;s&nbsp;extended network&nbsp;are also public. I imagine most users are not going to want to have all of their Twttr messages published on a public website.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>I do not understand the utility of adding the SMS messages to a public webpage or making messages from my network public. I would have to pass on that type of offering. The ability to make messages private should be added asap.&nbsp;</p>

No revenue model. I asked their VC - CRV - what the revenue model was a year ago and he said "to sell to someone bigger." Okay, that was a web 1.0 answer, and now we get Twttr - an even dumber idea with no revenue model, but a 2.0 concept.</blockquote>

Who would want all their personal text messages on a public website for anyone to read and track?&nbsp;</blockquote>

<div>Finally, a last blog comment that caught my attention on an other&nbsp;<a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/07/16/twttr.php">old Twitter article</a>:</div>

Meh, I'm just glad it exists now. It was a personal itch I wanted to scratch and I'm not going to complain&nbsp;at all&nbsp;if someone else scratches it. Plus the Odeo guys made it much prettier than I would have. -&nbsp;Bob Aman</blockquote>

<div>I'd be curious to know if the John Resign being referred to is the same guy who went on to build <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig">John Resig</a> really almost build a Twitter before Twitter?</div>
